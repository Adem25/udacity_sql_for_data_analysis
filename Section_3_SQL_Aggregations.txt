COUNT:
Notice that COUNT does not consider rows that have NULL values. 
Here is an example of finding all the rows in the accounts table:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM accounts;

SUM:
Unlike COUNT, you can only use SUM on numeric columns. 
However, SUM will ignore NULL values, as do the other aggregation functions.

QUIZ SUM:
Find the total amount spent on standard_amt_usd and gloss_amt_usd paper for each order in the orders table. 
This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table.

SELECT standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd AS total_standard_gloss
FROM orders;

Find the standard_amt_usd per unit of standard_qty paper. Your solution should use both an aggregation and a mathematical operator.

SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_price_per_unit
FROM orders;

MIN & MAX:
Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns and ignores NULL. 
Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible. 
As you might suspect, MAX does the opposite—it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to “Z.”

AVG
Similar to other software AVG returns the mean of the data - that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column. 
This aggregate function again ignores the NULL values in both the numerator and the denominator.

If you want to count NULLs as zero, you will need to use SUM and COUNT. 
However, this is probably not a good idea if the NULL values truly just represent unknown values for a cell.

MEDIAN - Expert Tip
One quick note that a median might be a more appropriate measure of center for this data, 
but finding the median happens to be a pretty difficult thing to get using SQL alone — 
so difficult that finding a median is occasionally asked as an interview question.

QUIZ MIN MAX AVG:
1 When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.
SELECT MIN(orders.occurred_at) AS earliest_order
FROM orders

2 Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function.
SELECT orders.occurred_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY orders.occurred_at
LIMIT 1

3 When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?
SELECT MAX(web_events.occurred_at) AS latest_web_event
FROM web_events

4 Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.
SELECT web_events.occurred_at
FROM web_events
ORDER BY web_events.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1

5 Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order. 
Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) mean_gloss, 
              AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster, AVG(standard_amt_usd) mean_standard_usd, 
              AVG(gloss_amt_usd) mean_gloss_usd, AVG(poster_amt_usd) mean_poster_usd
FROM orders;

6 Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN. 
Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding - what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders? 
Note, this is more advanced than the topics we have covered thus far to build a general solution, but we can hard code a solution in the following way.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd
         FROM orders
         ORDER BY total_amt_usd
         LIMIT 3457) AS Table1
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 2;


QUIZ GROUP BY:
1 Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should have the account name and the date of the order.
SELECT a.name, o.occurred_at
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
 ON a.id = o.account_id
ORDER BY o.occurred_at
LIMIT 1

2 Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each company's orders in usd and the company name.
SELECT a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS  total_sales_each_account
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
 ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name

3 Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? 
Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.
SELECT a.name, w.occurred_at, w.channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
 ON a.id = w.account_id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1

4 Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was used. 
Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number of times the channel was used.
SELECT w.channel, COUNT(w.channel) AS count_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
 ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY w.channel

5 Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?
SELECT a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
 ON a.id = w.account_id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at
LIMIT 1

6 What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. 
Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.
SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY smallest_order;

7 Find the number of sales reps in each region. 
Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps. Order from fewest reps to most reps.
SELECT r.name, COUNT(s.name) AS count_sales_reps_name
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
 ON s.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY count_sales_reps_name


QUIZ GROUP BY II
1 For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. 
Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average spent on each of the paper types.
SELECT a.name, AVG(o.standard_qty) avg_stand, AVG(o.gloss_qty) avg_gloss, AVG(o.poster_qty) avg_post
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;

2 For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. 
Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.
SELECT a.name, AVG(o.standard_amt_usd) avg_stand, AVG(o.gloss_amt_usd) avg_gloss, AVG(o.poster_amt_usd) avg_post
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;

3 Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. 
Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
SELECT s.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;

4 Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. 
Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. 
Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;

QUIZ DISTINCT
1 Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.

The below two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is associated with only one region. 
If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query should have returned more rows than the second query.

SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id", 
a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name"
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;

and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;

2 Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

Actually all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. The fewest number of accounts any sales rep works on is 3. 
There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. 
Using DISTINCT in the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM sales_reps;

QUIZ HAVNING
1 How many of the sales reps have more than 5 accounts that they manage?
SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY num_accounts;
and technically, we can get this using a SUBQUERY as shown below. This same logic can be used for the other queries, but this will not be shown.

SELECT COUNT(*) num_reps_above5
FROM(SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
        FROM accounts a
        JOIN sales_reps s
        ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
        GROUP BY s.id, s.name
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
        ORDER BY num_accounts) AS Table1;

2 How many accounts have more than 20 orders?
SELECT a.id, a.name, COUNT(*) num_orders
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
ORDER BY num_orders;

3 Which account has the most orders?
SELECT a.id, a.name, COUNT(*) num_orders
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY num_orders DESC
LIMIT 1;

4 How many accounts spent more than 30,000 usd total across all orders?
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 30000
ORDER BY total_spent;

5 How many accounts spent less than 1,000 usd total across all orders?
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 1000
ORDER BY total_spent;

6 Which account has spent the most with us?
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;

7 Which account has spent the least with us?
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY total_spent
LIMIT 1;

8 Which accounts used facebook as a channel to contact customers more than 6 times?
SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
HAVING COUNT(*) > 6 AND w.channel = 'facebook'
ORDER BY use_of_channel;

9 Which account used facebook most as a channel?
SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
WHERE w.channel = 'facebook'
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
ORDER BY use_of_channel DESC
LIMIT 1;
Note: This query above only works if there are no ties for the account that used facebook the most. 
It is a best practice to use a larger limit number first such as 3 or 5 to see if there are ties before using LIMIT 1.

10 Which channel was most frequently used by most accounts?
SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
ORDER BY use_of_channel DESC
LIMIT 10;
All of the top 10 are direct.

QUZ DATE
1 Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly sales totals?
SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all other years. 
If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). 
Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. Sales have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being the largest sales to date. 
At this rate, we might expect 2017 to have the largest sales.

2 Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?
In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as discussed above.
SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 
The greatest sales amounts occur in December (12).

3 Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?
SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the other years in the dataset.

4 Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?
SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 
December still has the most sales, but interestingly, November has the second most sales (but not the most dollar sales. To make a fair comparison from one month to another 2017 and 2013 data were removed.

5 In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) ord_date, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o 
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
May 2016 was when Walmart spent the most on gloss paper.
